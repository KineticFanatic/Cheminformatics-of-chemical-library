# Cheminformatics-analysis-of-chemical-library
 
# Background
Cheminformatics studies have shown that most of the drug molecules occupy a very small portion of the vast ‘chemical space’ that remains to be explored, especially in the context of drug discovery. Generation of synthetically tractable virtual libraries belonging to the unexplored portion of the chemical universe in combination with the virtual screening (VS) technologies can provide novel scaffolds as a starting point for a lead generation against therapeutic targets. 

# Methodology
We generated a small combinatorial library based on Ugi-reaction, a well-known Multi-component reaction (MCR) that provides a diverse set of molecules in one synthetic step. A diverse set of commercially available heterocyclic components (aldehydes, amines, carboxylic acids and isonitriles) were used to develop the library. Cheminformatics analysis and comparison with the existing drugs and natural-products suggest that the molecules in this library indeed represent a different and novel chemical space. 

# Conclusion
Thus, this virtual library provides a useful tool for drug design in combination with various VS techniques. Since the library members are products of the highly versatile Ugi-reaction, the virtual hits are amenable to rapid one-step synthesis and further experimental validation.
